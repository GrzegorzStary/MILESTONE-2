### Project Goals

## Project Purpose

A web-based game that challenges players' reflexes and coordination, inspired by the mechanics of the popular game Flappy Bird.

#### Client Goals

This project was developed as part of my Diploma in Web Application Development with Code Institute, serving as a key learning milestone in frontend interactivity and JavaScript development. There was no real life client for this project. However, I approached the game as a real-world product, ensuring it was well-structured, engaging, and had clear objectives that aligned with a potential client’s needs. 

*Providing an engaging gameplay experience that tests users' reflexes, precision, and reaction time.
*Appealing to both existing fans of Flappy Bird and new players, offering a familiar yet polished and refined version of the classic gameplay.
*Encouraging replayability by designing an intuitive yet progressively challenging game that keeps users coming back.
*Expanding the client’s content portfolio with a simple yet effective web-based game that can drive user engagement and retention.
*Enhancing accessibility by ensuring the game is lightweight, browser-friendly, and easy to play on multiple devices.
*Creating a fun and time-killing experience that players can enjoy casually while promoting the client’s platform or brand.

#### User Goals:

The target audience for this game includes players of all ages who enjoy casual, fast-paced challenges.

*Challenge their reflexes and coordination by navigating obstacles with precise timing.
*Enjoy a fun, fast-paced game that is easy to pick up but difficult to master.
*Experience a game with simple yet addictive mechanics, encouraging repeated playthroughs.
*Compete against themselves or others by improving their high scores and striving for better performance.

#### Content

The game consists of a simple yet engaging mechanic, where players control a bird navigating through obstacles by tapping or clicking to stay airborne.

Key elements of the game include:

The Bird: A small, pixel-art character, requiring precise timing to avoid crashing.
Obstacles: Moving tree trunks that create gaps the player must navigate through.
Scoring System: Players earn points for each obstacle they successfully pass through, encouraging them to improve their performance. The Best Score feature records the highest score achieved, motivating players to beat their personal best or challenge others for a higher score.

Overview of Page Content

When the game starts, the bird is placed at the starting position, and the player begins tapping to keep it airborne.
The player must navigate the bird through a series of obstacles (pipes) by tapping or clicking to control its flight.
Each successful passage through a pair of pipes earns the player one point.
There is a Best Score tracker that displays the highest score the player has achieved.
The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle, and the player’s final score is displayed.
Highest score is recorded once new score exceedes the old one.
