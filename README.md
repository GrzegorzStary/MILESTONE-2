### Project Goals

## Project Purpose

A web-based game that challenges players' reflexes and coordination, inspired by the mechanics of the popular game Flappy Bird.

#### Client Goals

This project was developed as part of my Diploma in Web Application Development with Code Institute, serving as a key learning milestone in frontend interactivity and JavaScript development. There was no real life client for this project. However, I approached the game as a real-world product, ensuring it was well-structured, engaging, and had clear objectives that aligned with a potential client’s needs. 

*Providing an engaging gameplay experience that tests users' reflexes, precision, and reaction time.
*Appealing to both existing fans of Flappy Bird and new players, offering a familiar yet polished and refined version of the classic gameplay.
*Encouraging replayability by designing an intuitive yet progressively challenging game that keeps users coming back.
*Expanding the client’s content portfolio with a simple yet effective web-based game that can drive user engagement and retention.
*Enhancing accessibility by ensuring the game is lightweight, browser-friendly, and easy to play on multiple devices.
*Creating a fun and time-killing experience that players can enjoy casually while promoting the client’s platform or brand.

#### User Goals:

The target audience for this game includes players of all ages who enjoy casual, fast-paced challenges.

*Challenge their reflexes and coordination by navigating obstacles with precise timing.
*Enjoy a fun, fast-paced game that is easy to pick up but difficult to master.
*Experience a game with simple yet addictive mechanics, encouraging repeated playthroughs.
*Compete against themselves or others by improving their high scores and striving for better performance.
*Engage in a lightweight, browser-friendly game that requires no downloads or installations.
*Pass time in an entertaining way, whether during short breaks, commutes, or leisure moments.
